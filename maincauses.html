        <div id="limit20">
          <p>There were few floods that were caused by:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>High Tides</li>
            <li>Avalanche</li>
            <li>Tidal Surge</li>

            <li>Levee Failure</li>
            <li>Storm Surge</li>
            <li>Hurricane</li>
            <li>Winter Storm</li>
          </ul>
          <br>
          <br>
          <p>Each cause that has been listed above had not cause more than 10 cases of floods counted from 1985 - 2020</p>
        </div>
        <div id="limit50">
          <p>
            Some events cause more cases compared to the previous ones. <span style="color: red;">Cyclone</span> caused around 22 cases so far 
            while <span style="color: red;">Ice Jams</span> are recorded to cause more cases, which is 32 cases of floods from 1985-2020. 
            <span style="color: red;">Rain and Snowmelts</span> caused more number of floods with 48 cases were recorded to be caused by this event.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div id="limit200">
          <p>
            Several events are even causing more cases such as <span style="color: red;">79 cases</span> were caused by Snowmelt, 
            <span style="color: red;">154 cases</span> were caused by Tropical Storm and <span style="color: red;">57 cases</span> 
            were recorded as floods that were caused by Dam/Levy Break or Release.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div id="limit600">
          <p>
            <span style="color: red;">More and more</span> floods are caused by the other issues and most of them are caused by 
            <span style="color: red;">rain</span> such as <span style="color: red;">Torrential Rain</span> that has caused 539 cases so far, 
            <span style="color: red;">Moonson Rain</span> with its 436 cases, <span style="color: red;">Tropical Cyclone</span> with 340 cases of floods 
            while <span style="color: red;">Brief Torrential Rain</span> is recorded being able to cause 210 cases of floods from 1985 until 2020.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div id="limit3000">
          <p>
            <strong><span style="color: red;">The Main Causes</span></strong> of floods that have been recorded is 
          </p>
          <p id="HeavyRain"><strong><span style="color: red;">Heavy Rain</span></strong></p>
          <p>
            Unexpectedly, there were around <strong><span style="color: red;">2998 cases</span></strong> that have been recorded that were caused by Heavy Rain.
            We cannot do a lot of thing to control the intensity of a rain, but since we have known that heavy rain is the main cause of most floods in that have been happened, 
            we need to pay extra attention on our waterways to make sure that the water will not overflow when a heavy is coming and we also need to prepare our environment to 
            store the water volume that will be brought by the heavy rain by doing Reforestation.
