      <h1>We need you!</h1>
      <p>
        We live in a world that consists of human, animal, plant and non-living things.
        Human as a creature that has sense should take care of the environment since we are living in
        the environment itself. By having a good environment, we can have a better life and a more sustainable future.
        However, by the increasing number of humans in this world and the need of industrialisations,
        a lot of exploitation happens in our surrounding. As the result, the condition of our environment
        becomes worse while there is not any significant action that has been taken to “recover” our environment.
        A lot of natural disaster happens more frequently such as bushfire, storms and floods. The quality of our daily
        life will also be affected by the bad environment such as pollution and global warming.
      </p>
      <p>
        We will focus on one of the natural disasters that happens more frequently and becomes worse,
        especially in my hometown. This topic is really close to me because I live in a village that is
        surrounded by 2 rivers. Every year, our village have to suffer from floods and a lot of people need
        to find the other place to stay for a while. Not only that, the economy in my village becomes dormant
        and there is not any significant action that has been taken to prevent the floods from happening again
        in the future. I realized that this issue happens because the community itself has not seen this disaster
        as a serious thing while the flood itself in reality becomes worse by year. A lot of people think that this
        issue happens because of the rule of the nature. They do not realize that a lot of forest that should be
        used to absorb the rain water have been used to plant palm that cannot absorb the rain water as much as the
        forest did. In addition, they do not plant the other tree to replace the used one so it makes thing even worse.
        As the result, the river cannot accommodate all the water volume with the silt that also becomes one aspect that
        cause flood. However, people still look at this issue as a thing that should be suffered by human because of the
        rule of nature.

        <h2>Main Causes of Flood</h2>
        <p>
          Floods can occur because of some reasons. It can be naturally caused by the weather or it can also be caused by the effect
          of human's actions such as deforestation and clogged drains. We need to know the main causes of floods that have been a
          global issue in order to take the right action according to the causes of flood. The visualisations will show us the most
          frequent causes of floods that have been recorded globally.

        <h2>Timeline of Flood</h2>
        <p>
          Flood has been an annual natural disaster for certain places. The weather condition may also be a really important aspect that
          need to condired when we are doing a research about floods. The weather that may change throughout the year can give us a hint
          about the pattern of the floods. How long does a flood happen will also tell us about how we should be prepared in order to survive
          the flood.

        <h2>Impacts of Flood</h2>
        <p>
          Floods have caused a lot of loss. A lot of people were displaced and it keeps happening for every year, even worse. Material loss
          are also being a big issue where a lot of houses are being destroyed by the floods.
          In order to open our eyes on how serious this issue is, we need to know the severity of a flood so we can see that this issue
          usually came with a lot of bad impacts both for the environment and human.
